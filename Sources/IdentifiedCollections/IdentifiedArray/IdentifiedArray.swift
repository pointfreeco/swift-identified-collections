import OrderedCollections

/// An ordered collection of identifiable elements.
///
/// Similar to the standard `Array`, identified arrays maintain their elements in a particular
/// user-specified order, and they support efficient random access traversal of their members.
/// However, unlike `Array`, identified arrays introduce the ability to uniquely identify elements,
/// using a hash table to ensure that no two elements have the same identity, and to efficiently
/// look up elements corresponding to specific identifiers.
///
/// ``IdentifiedArray`` is a useful alternative to `Array` when you need to be able to efficiently
/// access unique elements by a stable identifier. It is also a useful alternative to `OrderedSet`,
/// where the `Hashable` requirement may be too strict.
///
/// You can create an identified array with any element type that conforms to the `Identifiable`
/// protocol.
///
/// ```swift
/// struct User: Identifiable { var id: String }
/// var users: IdentifiedArray = [User(id: "u_42"), User(id: "u_1729")]
/// ```
///
/// Or you can provide a key path that describes an element's identity:
///
/// ```swift
/// var numbers = IdentifiedArray(id: \Int.self)
/// ```
///
/// # Motivation
///
/// When modeling a collection of elements in your application's state, it is easy to reach for a
/// standard `Array`. However, as your application becomes more complex, this approach can break
/// down in many ways, including accidentally making mutations to the wrong elements or even
/// crashing. üò¨
///
/// For example, if you were building a "Todos" application in SwiftUI, you might model an
/// individual todo in an identifiable value type:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Todo: Identifiable {
///   var description = ""
///   let id: UUID
///   var isComplete = false
/// }
/// ```
///
/// And you would hold an array of these todos as a published field in your app's view model:
///
/// ```swift
/// class TodosViewModel: ObservableObject {
///   @Published var todos: [Todo] = []
/// }
/// ```
///
/// A view can render a list of these todos quite simply, and because they are identifiable we can
/// even omit the `id` parameter of `List`:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct TodosView: View {
///   @ObservedObject var viewModel: TodosViewModel
///
///   var body: some View {
///     List(self.viewModel.todos) { todo in
///       ...
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If your deployment target is set to the latest version of SwiftUI, you may be tempted to pass
/// along a binding to the list so that each row is given mutable access to its todo. This will work
/// for simple cases, but as soon as you introduce side effects, like API clients or analytics, or
/// want to write unit tests, you must push this logic into a view model, instead. And that means
/// each row must be able to communicate its actions back to the view model.
///
/// You could do so by introducing some endpoints on the view model, like when a row's completed
/// toggle is changed:
///
/// ```swift
/// class TodosViewModel: ObservableObject {
///   ...
///   func todoCheckboxToggled(at id: Todo.ID) {
///     guard let index = self.todos.firstIndex(where: { $0.id == id })
///     else { return }
///
///     self.todos[index].isComplete.toggle()
///     // TODO: Update todo on backend using an API client
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This code is simple enough, but it can require a full traversal of the array to do its job.
///
/// Perhaps it would be more performant for a row to communicate its index back to the view model
/// instead, and then it could mutate the todo directly via its index subscript. But this makes the
/// view more complicated:
///
/// ```swift
/// List(self.viewModel.todos.enumerated(), id: \.element.id) { index, todo in
///   ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This isn't so bad, but at the moment it doesn't even compile. An
/// [evolution proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0312-indexed-and-enumerated-zip-collections.md)
/// may change that soon, but in the meantime `List` and `ForEach` must be passed a
/// `RandomAccessCollection`, which is perhaps most simply achieved by constructing another array:
///
/// ```swift
/// List(Array(self.viewModel.todos.enumerated()), id: \.element.id) { index, todo in
///   ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This compiles, but we've just moved the performance problem to the view: every time this body is
/// evaluated there's the possibility a whole new array is being allocated.
///
/// But even if it were possible to pass an enumerated collection directly to these views,
/// identifying an element of mutable state by an index introduces a number of other problems.
///
/// While it's true that we can greatly simplify and improve the performance of any view model
/// methods that mutate an element through its index subscript:
///
/// ```swift
/// class TodosViewModel: ObservableObject {
///   ...
///   func todoCheckboxToggled(at index: Int) {
///     self.todos[index].isComplete.toggle()
///     // TODO: sync with API
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Any asynchronous work that we add to this endpoint must take great care in _not_ using this
/// index later on. An index is not a stable identifier: todos can be moved and removed at any time,
/// and an index identifying "Buy lettuce" at one moment may identify "Call Mom" the next, or worse,
/// may be a completely invalid index and crash your application!
///
/// ```swift
/// class TodosViewModel: ObservableObject {
///   ...
///   func todoCheckboxToggled(at index: Int) async {
///     self.todos[index].isComplete.toggle()
///
///     do {
///       // ‚ùå Could update the wrong todo, or crash!
///       self.todos[index] = try await self.apiClient.updateTodo(self.todos[index])
///     } catch {
///       // Handle error
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Whenever you need to access a particular todo after performing some asynchronous work, you
/// _must_ do the work of traversing the array:
///
/// ```swift
/// class TodosViewModel: ObservableObject {
///   ...
///   func todoCheckboxToggled(at index: Int) async {
///     self.todos[index].isComplete.toggle()
///
///     // 1Ô∏è‚É£ Get a reference to the todo's id before kicking off the async work
///     let id = self.todos[index].id
///
///     do {
///       // 2Ô∏è‚É£ Update the todo on the backend
///       let updatedTodo = try await self.apiClient.updateTodo(self.todos[index])
///
///       // 3Ô∏è‚É£ Find the updated index of the todo after the async work is done
///       let updatedIndex = self.todos.firstIndex(where: { $0.id == id })!
///
///       // 4Ô∏è‚É£ Update the correct todo
///       self.todos[updatedIndex] = updatedTodo
///     } catch {
///       // Handle error
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Identified collections are designed to solve all of these problems by providing data structures
/// for working with collections of identifiable elements in an ergonomic, performant way.
///
/// Most of the time, you can simply swap an `Array` out for an ``IdentifiedArray``:
///
/// ```swift
/// import IdentifiedCollections
///
/// class TodosViewModel: ObservableObject {
///   @Published var todos: IdentifiedArrayOf<Todo> = []
///   ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Here we use ``IdentifiedArrayOf`` generic over `Todo` as a shorthand for
/// `IdentifiedArray<Todo.ID, Todo>`.
///
/// And then you can mutate an element directly via its id-based subscript, no traversals needed,
/// even after asynchronous work is performed:
///
/// ```swift
/// class TodosViewModel: ObservableObject {
///   ...
///   func todoCheckboxToggled(at id: Todo.ID) async {
///     self.todos[id: id]?.isComplete.toggle()
///
///     do {
///       // 1Ô∏è‚É£ Update todo on backend and mutate it in the todos identified array.
///       self.todos[id: id] = try await self.apiClient.updateTodo(self.todos[id: id]!)
///     } catch {
///       // Handle error
///     }
///
///     // No step 2Ô∏è‚É£ üòÜ
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// You can also simply pass the identified array to views like `List` and `ForEach` without any
/// complications:
///
/// ```swift
/// List(self.viewModel.todos) { todo in
///   ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Sequence and Collection Operations
///
/// Identified arrays are random-access collections. Members are assigned integer indices, with the
/// first element always being at index `0`.
///
/// Because ``IdentifiedArray`` needs to keep its members unique, it cannot conform to the full
/// `MutableCollection` or `RangeReplaceableCollection` protocols. Operations such as
/// `MutableCollection`'s subscript setter or `RangeReplaceableCollection`'s `replaceSubrange`
/// assume the ability to insert/replace arbitrary elements in the collection, but allowing that
/// could lead to duplicate values.
///
/// However, ``IdentifiedArray`` is able to partially implement these two protocols; namely, there
/// is no issue with mutation operations that merely change the order of elements, or just remove
/// some subset of existing members:
///
/// ```swift
/// // Permutation operations from MutableCollection:
/// func swapAt(_ i: Int, _ j: Int)
/// func partition(by predicate: (Element) throws -> Bool) -> rethrows Int
/// func sort() where Element: Comparable
/// func sort(by predicate: (Element, Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows
/// func shuffle()
/// func shuffle<T: RandomNumberGenerator>(using generator: inout T)
/// func reverse()
///
/// // Removal operations from RangeReplaceableCollection:
/// func removeAll(keepingCapacity: Bool = false)
/// func remove(at index: Int) -> Element
/// func removeSubrange(_ bounds: Range<Int>)
/// func removeLast() -> Element
/// func removeLast(_ n: Int)
/// func removeFirst() -> Element
/// func removeFirst(_ n: Int)
/// func removeAll(where shouldBeRemoved: (Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows
/// ```
///
/// ``IdentifiedArray`` also implements `reserveCapacity(_)` from `RangeReplaceableCollection`, to
/// allow for efficient insertion of a known number of elements. (However, unlike `Array` and `Set`,
/// `OrderedSet` does not provide a `capacity` property.)
///
/// # Performance
///
/// Like the standard `Dictionary` type, the performance of hashing operations in
/// ``IdentifiedArray`` is highly sensitive to the quality of hashing implemented by the `ID`
/// type. Failing to correctly implement hashing can easily lead to unacceptable performance, with
/// the severity of the effect increasing with the size of the underlying hash table.
///
/// In particular, if a certain set of elements all produce the same hash value, then hash table
/// lookups regress to searching an element in an unsorted array, i.e., a linear operation. To
/// ensure hashed collection types exhibit their target performance, it is important to ensure that
/// such collisions cannot be induced merely by adding a particular list of members to the set.
///
/// The easiest way to achieve this is to make sure `ID` implements hashing following `Hashable`'s
/// documented best practices. The conformance must implement the `hash(into:)` requirement, and
/// every bit of information that is compared in `==` needs to be combined into the supplied
/// `Hasher` value. When used correctly, `Hasher` produces high-quality, randomly seeded hash values
/// that prevent repeatable hash collisions.
///
/// When `ID` implements `Hashable` correctly, testing for membership in an ordered set is expected
/// to take O(1) equality checks on average. Hash collisions can still occur organically, so the
/// worst-case lookup performance is technically still O(*n*) (where *n* is the size of the set);
/// however, long lookup chains are unlikely to occur in practice.
///
/// ## Implementation Details
///
/// An identified array consists of an ordered dictionary of id-element pairs. An element's id
/// should not be mutated in place, as it will drift from its associated dictionary key. Identified
/// array is designed to avoid this invariant, with the exception of its *id-based* subscript.
/// Mutating an element's id will result in a runtime error.
